how I can build this element so that it has a different behavior on medium and small screens

I need this component to behave differently on smaller screens, what is the best way to do this, on the own component or on the grid in which it will be imported.

What is the best practice for me to guarantee responsiveness on medium screens I would like this, I would like these items: Cards Components Stacks


My content is very close despite the breakdowns, how I can centralize and control more dynamically, the content is overlapping other 'sections'

What is happening my content has lost all your style and my footer too.

What parameters should I should be so that I can dispose of the elements on larger inline and smaller and medium -sided canvases, the contents of my box are coming out and breaking the content.
